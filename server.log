(node:8633) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///home/user/webapp/next.config.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /home/user/webapp/package.json.
